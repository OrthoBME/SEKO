Image Segmentation Knee Histology
Overview

This protocol describes how to use a deep learning model for image segmentation, specifically tailored for histilogical images in TIFF/TIF format. The process includes training the model with a set of images and their corresponding masks and predicting segmentation on new images.
Prerequisites

    Python 3.x installed
    Required libraries: Keras, NumPy, OpenCV, TensorFlow, scikit-learn, matplotlib, PIL
    A set of TIFF/TIF images and corresponding mask images for training
    New TIFF/TIF images for prediction

Environment Setup

    Create a virtual environment:

python -m venv myenv

Activate the virtual environment:

    Windows: myenv\Scripts\activate
    macOS/Linux: source myenv/bin/activate

Install the required libraries:

    pip install tensorflow keras numpy opencv-python scikit-learn matplotlib Pillow

File Structure

    Training script: train_model.py
    Prediction script: predict_images.py
    Images folder (input images and corresponding masks for training, new images for prediction)

Training the Model

    Prepare your dataset:
        Organize your training images and masks in a CSV file with columns "Input" and "Mask", each row containing paths to the training image and its corresponding mask.
    Run the training script:

    python train_model.py

        The script will train the model using the provided dataset and save the best model based on validation loss.
    The trained model will be saved in the specified path (modify the script to set your model save path).

Predicting with the Model

    Ensure you have a trained model file (.hdf5) ready.
    Place your new TIFF/TIF images in the specified input directory.
    Update the predict_images.py script with the correct paths for your model, input directory, and output directory.
    Run the prediction script:

    python predict_images.py

        The script will generate predictions for the new images and save them in the specified output directory, both in original prediction format and a visualized format.

Notes

    The scripts are configured for images of size 256x192. If your images are of a different size, you may need to resize them or adjust the model architecture accordingly.
    The number of classes (n_classes) is set based on your dataset. Modify it according to the number of segmentation classes in your masks.
